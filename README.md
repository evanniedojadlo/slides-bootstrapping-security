# Bootstrapping a Security Process

This talk discusses bootstrapping a software security process at a company. Software security is something that's overlooked in the beginning stages of building most companies. This talk addresses accelerating some Day 1 and Day 2 security operations.

The focus is on small and medium-sized companies, but some of these methods can be applied anywhere.
